# React Timer Advanced

A basic countdown timer that offers an advanced UI experience. The _Timer_ uses a _Keypad_ to enter hours, minutes, and seconds into a _Display_. The countdown timer changes to fullscreen when the _Timer_ is started. A control panel allows one to start, stop, resume, and reset the timer.

This project also demonstrates:

* a typcial React project layout structure
* babel setup and configuration
* webpack setup and configuration
* eslint setup and configuration
* SCSS setup and configuration
